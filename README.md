# CÎ¼MD Implementation for PLUMED2

This repository hosts the implementation for [PLUMED 2](https://www.plumed.org) of the CmuMD method, which allows to mimic open boundary conditions in NVT molecular simulations involving solid/fluid interfaces, and enables the simulation of concentration-driven fluxes through porous membranes. 

The method, with an application to crystal growth is described in the paper: 

__[1] Molecular dynamics simulations of solutions at constant chemical potential__  
C Perego, M Salvalaglio, M Parrinello, [J Chem Phys (14), 144113, 2015](https://moodle.ucl.ac.uk/course/view.php?id=1191), [arxiv](https://arxiv.org/abs/1501.07825)

The adaptation of CmuMD to model concentration driven membrane fluxes is described in the paper: 

__[2] Concentration gradient driven molecular dynamics: a new method for simulations of membrane permeation and separation__ 
A Ozcan, C Perego, M Salvalaglio, M Parrinello, O Yazaydin
[Chem Sci 8 (5), 3858-3865, 2017](https://pubs.rsc.org/en/content/articlepdf/2017/sc/c6sc04978h)

The version hosted here has been developed by [Dr. Claudio Perego](https://scholar.google.co.uk/citations?user=TwqxhpUAAAAJ) and is maintained by the [Salvalaglio](http://www.ucl.ac.uk/molecular-modelling) and [Yazaydin](https://www.ucl.ac.uk/~ucecoya/) groups at [UCL Chemical Engineering](https://www.ucl.ac.uk/chemical-engineering/). 

The method has been further developed into a "cannibalistic" variant, and to model crystal nucleation at constant supersaturation by [Dr. Tarak Karmakar](https://scholar.google.co.uk/citations?hl=en&user=LWBFC34AAAAJ). 

### Installation

CMUMD is implemented as a PLUMED 2 Collective Variable (CV), the purpose of which is that of computing the density in a specific region of the simulation box. 
The derivatives of such variable are suitably modified to apply forces at the interface between a physical region of the simulation box and the system' reservoir.   

__NB:__ _CMUMD is defined as a CV but IT IS NOT an actual CV, the derivatives are formally wrong for any typical CV usage._

The forces are then applied by using the `RESTRAINT` keyword in PLUMED 2 (see the examples following). The method as implemented in this repository can be applied only to a planar geometry. 

__In order to install CmuMD:__ 

1. Download the file `Cmumd.cpp` 
2. Copy the source code in the PLUMED source directory:  
`cp CMUMD.cpp $PLUMED_DIR/src/colvar` 
3. [compile PLUMED 2](https://www.plumed.org/doc-v2.6/user-doc/html/_installation.html)


### Example 1: Concentration Driven Flux - methane permeation in a ZIF-8 membrane

This example reports the PLUMED file used to implement the method discussed in [Ozcan et al., Chem Sci, 2017](https://pubs.rsc.org/en/content/articlepdf/2017/sc/c6sc04978h). 
The input files for a typical simulation are available in `Examples/Example1_methane_permeation_in_ZIF-8_membrane`
